## [Vue](https://vuejs.org/)

An approachable, performant and versatile framework for building web user interfaces.

Builds on top of standard HTML, CSS and JavaScript with intuitive API and documentation. Truly reactive, compiler-optimized rendering system. Incrementally adoptable ecosystem that scales between a library and a full-featured framework.

## [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com)

FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.8+ based on standard Python type hints.

Very high performance, on par with NodeJS and Go (thanks to Starlette and Pydantic). Based on (and fully compatible with) the open standards for APIs: OpenAPI and JSON Schema.

## [Airbyte](https://airbyte.com)

Open-source EL(T) tool that syncs data from applications, APIs and databases to warehouses. It allows to build custom connectors for specific and complex content manipulation.

Efficient (and easy) to synchronize SQL databases in a reliable way, to fetch data from popular public APIs and to deal with rare formats/dependencies in isolation.

## [DBT](https://www.getdbt.com)

SQL-first transformation workflow that lets teams quickly and collaboratively deploy analytics code following software engineering best practices like modularity, portability, CI/CD, and documentation.

Replace boilerplate DDL/DML with simple SQL SELECT statements that infer dependencies, build tables and views, and run models in order.
