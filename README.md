## [VueJS](vuejs/README.md)

An approachable, performant and versatile framework for building web user interfaces.

Builds on top of standard HTML, CSS and JavaScript with intuitive API and documentation. Truly reactive, compiler-optimized rendering system. Incrementally adoptable ecosystem that scales between a library and a full-featured framework.

## [FastAPI](fastapi/README.md)

FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.8+ based on standard Python type hints.

Very high performance, on par with NodeJS and Go (thanks to Starlette and Pydantic). Based on (and fully compatible with) the open standards for APIs: OpenAPI and JSON Schema.

## [Streamlit](streamlit/README.md)



## [Spark](spark/README.md)



## [Airflow](airflow/README.md)

Open-source platform created by the community to programmatically author, schedule and monitor workflows.

Use standard Python features to create workflows, including date time formats for scheduling and loops to dynamically generate tasks.

## [Airbyte](airbyte/README.md)

Open-source EL(T) tool that syncs data from applications, APIs and databases to warehouses. It allows to build custom connectors for specific and complex content manipulation.

Efficient (and easy) to synchronize SQL databases in a reliable way, to fetch data from popular public APIs and to deal with rare formats/dependencies in isolation.

## [DBT](dbt/README.md)

SQL-first transformation workflow that lets teams quickly and collaboratively deploy analytics code following software engineering best practices like modularity, portability, CI/CD, and documentation.

Replace boilerplate DDL/DML with simple SQL SELECT statements that infer dependencies, build tables and views, and run models in order.

## [MinIO](minio/README.md)



## [PostgreSQL](postgres/README.md)



## [Kafka](kafka/README.md)

Apache Kafka is an open-source distributed event streaming platform for high-performance data pipelines, streaming analytics, data integration, and mission-critical applications.

Deliver messages at network limited throughput with low latencies. Elastically expand and contract storage and processing. Store streams of data safely in a distributed, durable, fault-tolerant cluster.

## [Kubernetes](kubernetes/README.md)

Also known as K8s, is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

It groups containers that make up an application into logical units for easy management and discovery. Kubernetes can scale without increasing operations team.

## [Terraform](terraform/README.md)
